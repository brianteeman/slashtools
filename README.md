Slash Tools is a set of keyboard shortcuts to use when creating content with Joomla 4 and the default editor (TinyMCE).

Without the need to change your focus from the keyboard to the mouse while you are typing Slash Tools will improve productivity. In addition to providing faster, keyboard focused, commands to familiar features of the editor Slash Tools adds some missing features that you will wonder how you ever managed without them.

## Features include
- Headings
- Lists
- Dummy text (Lorem Ipsum)
- Placeholder Images
- More to come

## Installation
This is a plugin for the TinyMCE that has been packaged to be easy to install and update with Joomla. It installs like every other Joomla extension but has one additional step to add it to TinyMCE.

### TinyMCE Configuration
After installing Slash Tools go to the Joomla Plugin Manager on the System dashboard and open the Editor - TinyMCE plugin.

Once open scroll to the very bottom where you will see the option to add External Plugin URLs. Enter the word **slashtools** as the Plugin Name and **/media/plg_editors_tinymce/js/plugins/slashtools/plugin.js** as the Plugin URL.

Save your change and that's all you need to do.
